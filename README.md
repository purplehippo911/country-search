## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) - React state management

### What I learned
I got to brush up on my knowledge about array methods, because I was working a lot with them, when I was rendering the country's information from the API. Learnt some basic NextJS and replaced `img`-element with Next's `Image`-element, to easier render images. Also got to learn some about object methods.


### Continued development
I'll focus on learning React Native and Firebase to make a productivity app. 

### Useful resources

- [NextJS Crashcourse by NetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g9gP2onazU5-2M-AzA8eBw) - This helped me get started with NextJS. I really liked this channel and will use it going forward.
